# What's The Right VPS?
Welcome! To the very annoying world of VPS shopping where you're filled with a lot of choices and you cant choose which one and you end up in your bedroom, crying over the painful choices you need to do just to buy a VPS.

## Introduction
For the past years, I've been with **T w o D i f f e r e n t V P S P r o v i d e r s** and going 3. And I'm supppeeerrr *annoyed* by the pricing, specs, and bandwidth. If you look at my projects, HypeBot is the f r i k n most resource-intensive of all. Simply, because of the Music System, running on 60MBPS every day on average. Okay! Let's go in-depth on how VPSes work, priced, and marketed.

## Mkay! How to VPSes work?

In our *f a v o r i t e* source of information, Wikipedia, described VPSes as ``a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service and runs its copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may have super user-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.`` Keep note of that as we will need this for reference. In short, VPSes are virtual machines. Which uses the idea of **Virtualization**. Virtualization, from Wikipedia, is basically: ``resources are still shared, as, under the time-sharing model, virtualization provides a higher level of security, dependent on the type of virtualization used, as the individual virtual servers are mostly isolated from each other and may run their full-fledged operating system which can be independently rebooted as a virtual instance. ``


## Huh? Do i even care about what kind of VPS i get?
YES! Duh, you should always check the specifications! You should look if you can use the **SUPERUSER** account as if you dont have this, you are limited by a *lot*. The best example of choosing the wrong VPS also is by looking at *discounts*. *Please dont look discounts, its irrelevant soon enough after the discounts finish*.

## Okay! Give me the choices!

**OKAY!** You said that we should look at the specifications of the VPS? Why are you giving us a price table? This is for your price budget. You need to look at your budget or range. Which provider fits the criteria of the budget range.

#### OVH
I have a personal experience with OVH as a VPS provider. 3 Years at least. But was forced to change due to the demands I need does not qualify with OVH. The issues I mostly encountered with ovh is unstable latency and internet speed. I recommend it for people who are setting up small projects such as Profile pages, discord bots, databases. Support's pretty fast personally.

#### Scaleway
Scaleway. I've only been with a month and its disk speed is running on 90 ~ 110 MBPS Read and Write. The Internet and latency are quite stable but there are some downtimes. With their cheapest plan with 2 Cores, 20 GB Space, 2 GB Ram with 200MBPS internet speed. It's quite nice for applications that are being tested out in the public or having a lot of nodejs projects. You do not have the option to reinstall the operating system though.

#### Linode
I've never tried Linode but its always part of the list that is being recommended to me. Based on research. It is pretty solid on its userbase and but some of its users are having trouble with Linode's user registration. I also quite think that the limitations Linode impose on resources is the only thing that I kinda go ehh maybe not this.

#### GalaxyGate
GalaxyGate's first impression reminds me of OVH's pricing before the new changes this 2020. Its pricing is well-matched with its resources. The biggest blow of GalaxyGate is the unmetered bandwidth and weekly backups feature. Not all VPS Providers provide this kind of resource. I would recommend them if you would have a high request rate on web applications since you have 500mbps to a Gigabit of internet speed.
Update: Okay GalaxyGate is great, support's on Discord so it's fast.

#### DigitalOcean
I would say, same with Linode but DigitalOcean has expanded with an array of choices ranging from 1GB to 192GB RAM and more. Still lacking the bandwidth specification. Would recommend this for people that codes as a hobby.

#### Vultr
Same with Linode and DigitalOcean.

#### RamNode
RamNode looks better than Linode, Vultr, and DigitalOcean as they have bigger resources starting with its CPU, Storage, and Bandwidth. But pricing depends on what kind of application you will be hosting. Will recommend this if you use more CPU power and storage but uses less bandwidth.

#### Contabo
Contabo for me is so much sketchy. And it's website looks way old. Reviews mostly say that they compress a lot of VPS instances on their servers and they use workstations on some of them. I've also seen people who say that it's also nice and a great buy. It depends on you if you would use this. Their resources are so huge that looks too hard to believe. If they were better on their web interface. Maybe I'll check it out.

## Well, okay now you tackled about the VPS providers above. Which one do you recommend? Or top 3?
If I sorted this by ranking. It will be:
1. GalaxyGate
2. OVH
3. Scaleway
4. RamNode
5. Vultr, DigitalOcean, Linode
6. Contabo

## Hey, I found something better! I think you should check it out!
Feel free to open up an issue in this repo and I'll check it out.
